## **About me:**

My career started as an economist. I was a department head for 8 years. I came to RS-School course on the advice of my friend. I really want to learn new skills and possible became junior frontend developer. I am also improving my English skills day after day. The first thing that attracts me in the IT field is a flexible work schedule without reference to time and place, the ability to move from street to street, from city to city, from country to country. The second thing I like about the junior front-end developer is that a beautiful website with all kinds of functionality is born from an empty page.

## **Skills:**

* Git, Github
* VScode
* HTML5
* CSS3, SASS
* JavaScript Basics

## **Code Example:**

`const countChars = (text, char) => {
  let i = 0;
  let count = 0;

  while (i < text.length) {
    if (text[i].toLowerCase() === char.toLowerCase()) {
        count = count + 1;
  }
    i = i + 1;
  }
  return count;
};`
