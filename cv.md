## **About me:**

My career started as an economist. I was a department head for 8 years. I came to RS-School course on the advice of my friend. I really want to learn new skills and possible became junior frontend developer. I am also improving my English skills day after day. The first thing that attracts me in the IT field is a flexible work schedule without reference to time and place, the ability to move from street to street, from city to city, from country to country. The second thing I like about the junior front-end developer is that a beautiful website with all kinds of functionality is born from an empty page.
